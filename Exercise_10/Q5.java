/* 5. How does the super keyword differ from the this keyword in Java? 
 * Provide an example to illustrate the difference.
 * 
 * Ans - 1. The this keyword:
			The this keyword refers to the current object â€” the instance of the class in which the keyword is used.
			--> It is used to refer to:
			The current instance of the class.
			The current class's instance variables (fields).
			The current class's constructors.
			('this' refers to the current instance of the class.)
			
		 2. The super keyword:
			The super keyword refers to the superclass (parent class) of the current object.
			--> It is used to:
			Access a method or variable from the superclass that is hidden or overridden by the current class.
			Call the constructor of the superclass.
			('super' refers to the parent class instance or superclass.)
